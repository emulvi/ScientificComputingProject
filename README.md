This is our project for NERS590.  Here you will find a repository including a basic Hartree Fock and MP2 code as well as partially optimized Hartree Fock and MP2 codes.  Unit tests are included to allow editing and testing of the following:

*Solvers for the Eigenvalues of a system
*Evaluaion of the Fock Matrix
*Improved speed of the partially-optimized vs non-optimized versions

This code can be run in parallel or serially and should be easily portable.

In addition, it is written in a format where it is easy to import different basis sets and call classes of the codes to implement in further projects.
